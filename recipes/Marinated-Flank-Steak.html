        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1/4 cup Soy Sauce</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. Vegetable Oil</li>
            <li>2 tbsp. Tomato Paste</li>
            <li>1 Garlic Clove, Minced</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. Dried Oregano</li>
            <li>3/4 tsp. Pepper</li>
            <li>1 lb Beef Flank Steak</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                In a large resealable plastic bag, combine the first six ingredients. Cut an 1/8-in.-deep diamond pattern into both sides of steak. Place in the bag; seal and turn to coat. Refrigerate overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain and discard marinade. Place steak on a broiler pan. Broil 4 in. from the heat for 7-8 minutes on each side or until meat reaches desired doneness (for medium-rare, a meat thermometer should read 145 degrees F; medium, 160 degrees F; well-done, 170 degrees F).
